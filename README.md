# Memory Game Project

This is an assignment that I completed for Udacity.com's Front End Nanodegree program.

## How to Open the Game

Open the game by double-clicking the index.html file or opening index.html from a browser program such Chrome or Safari or go to https://www.ramon-sanchez.com/memorygame/index.html

## Playing the Game

To play the game, click on one of the sixteen cards in the deck to reveal its symbol. Click on another card. If the symbols match, the cards will remain turned up. If they do not match, they will be turned down. The player wins when all sixteen cards are matched. A message screen will show the score as the number of moves played, a rating of up to three stars, and the amount of time played. The player can restart the game from this screen. The player can also restart the game at any time by clicking the resent button.
