## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How to Open the Game

Open the game by double-clicking the index.html file or opening index.html from a browser program such Chrome or Safari.

## Playing the Game

To play the game, click on one of the sixteen cards in the deck to reveal its symbol. Click on another card. If the symbols match, the cards will remain turned up. If they do not match, they will be turned down. The player wins when all sixteen cards are matched. A message screen will show the score as the number of moves played, a rating of up to three stars, and the amount of time played. The player can restart the game from this screen. The player can also restart the game at any time by clicking the resent button.
